Array Absurdity - M

Description

 

Imagine we have an immutable array of size N which we know to be filled with integers ranging from 0 to N-2, inclusive. Suppose we know that the array contains exactly one duplicated entry and that duplicate appears exactly twice. Find the duplicated entry.

 

Input

 

Your program should read lines of text from standard input. Each line begins with a positive integer N, the size of the array, followed by a semicolon, followed by a comma separated list of positive numbers ranging from 0 to N-2, inclusive.

 

Output

 

For each line of input, print to standard output the duplicated entry, each on its own line.
