**  Instructions:
**
**  Given a list of student test scores, find the best average grade.
**  Each student may have more than one test score in the list.
**
**  Complete the bestAverageGrade function in the editor below.
**  It has one parameter, scores, which is an array of student test scores.
**  Each element in the array is a two-element array of the form [student name, test score]
**  e.g. [ "Bobby", "87" ].
**  Test scores may be positive or negative integers.
**
**  If you end up with an average grade that is not an integer, you should
**  use a floor function to return the largest integer less than or equal to the average.
**  Return 0 for an empty input.
